# BucketList

## Technical Approach

I used Ruby on Rails to create this application.
There are two models: user and activities.
The relationship is there are many activities to a user.

## To Do
There are a few things I would like improve upon including:

- Better css layout
- A random activity generator
- A calendar to show how much time you have left before your activity begins.
