# README

I used Ruby on Rails to create this application.
There are two models: user and activities.
The relationship is there are many activities to a user.

There are a few things I would like improve upon including:
better css layout, I would like to improve upon the app also by including
a random activity generator and also maybe a calendar to show how much time you
have left before your activity begins.
